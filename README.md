This package has been archived due to BOM's ongoing unwillingness to allow programmatic access to their data and actively blocking any attempts made using this package or other similar efforts.

However, the [{weatherOz}](https://docs.ropensci.org/weatherOz/) package from rOpenSci provides a good alternative to this package now that you may find suits your needs.

The former README is now in [README-old](README-old.md).
